In this phase, we implemented multiple strategies to enhance the energy efficiency of AI systems while preserving performance. Model compression and pruning were applied to reduce model complexity, resulting in faster inference and lower power consumption without significant accuracy loss. Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) was used to automatically design models optimized for energy use, integrating real-time energy profiling and leveraging meta-learning for faster convergence. Dynamic resource allocation was introduced to predict and respond to workload variations, improving utilization, reducing latency, and managing thermal loads in real-time. These methods collectively enable AI systems to function more sustainably and cost-effectively, especially in edge and data center environments.

In parallel, hardware-aware AI optimization ensured models were tailored to specific hardware capabilities, including support for custom accelerators like FPGAs and neuromorphic processors, enhancing throughput and reducing energy use. Performance testing and continuous feedback loops were also established to validate efficiency gains in real-world settings and support iterative improvements. Key challenges addressed in this phase included the high energy demand of large models, inefficient hardware utilization, and growing data center power usage—tackled respectively through compression, hardware-specific optimization, and dynamic resource management. The outcomes of this phase position the project for scalable, adaptive, and sustainable AI deployment across a range of devices and applications.
